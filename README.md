# Illuminate Non-Laravel

Showing a simplest-use example for using each Illuminate component in non-Laravel applications.

## Usage
At the moment, the project is divided into many directories beneath public which will each contain an index file, usually written with [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/). Navigate to that directory in your terminal and run the following to serve a web site from that directory:

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser to view the output of each.

## Contributing
A few important notes:

 1. The imagined end user is a CodeIgniter developer copying the route closure directly into a project, so try to avoid using any Slim conventions and use as little code outside the closure as possible.
 2. While some components would be *easier* to implement with a Laravel-style Application instance and a fuller bootstrap, I'd prefer we implement as many as possible *without* loading Laravel's Service Providers.
 3. Some components will require a bootstrap, and I hope we can come up with a Best-Practice bootstrap and Laravel-style Application instance for loading Service Providers, etc.
